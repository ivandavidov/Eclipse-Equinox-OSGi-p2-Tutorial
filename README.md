# Eclipse-Equinox-OSGi-p2-Tutorial

This project includes Eclipse Equinox OSGi specific samples which cover the following scenarios:

* Create simple p2 repository which contains only one bundle. This involves the 'publisher' application.

* Create p2 profile which contains metadata for the bundle from the previously created repository. This involves the 'director' application.

* Start OSGi console.

The only prerequisite is to download Equinox OSGi p2 repository:

http://download.eclipse.org/equinox

TODO - add explanations about the agent and the connection between the downloaded equinox repository, the agent and the applications.
